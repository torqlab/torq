# System Architecture Requirements

## Purpose

Define architectural requirements for the PACE system's modular architecture to ensure robust, deterministic, and safe image generation from Strava activity data.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Core Functionality Pipeline

The system SHALL operate as a rule-based, deterministic pipeline that ingests Strava activity data via the Strava API, extracts semantic signals from activity metadata, generates text prompts following strict safety and content guardrails, creates artistic images using AI image generation models, and validates outputs to ensure compliance with all system constraints.

#### Scenario: Complete activity processing pipeline
- **GIVEN** a Strava activity ID from a webhook
- **WHEN** the system processes the activity
- **THEN** the system SHALL ingest activity data, extract signals, generate prompts, create images, and validate outputs in sequence

#### Scenario: Deterministic pipeline behavior
- **GIVEN** identical activity inputs
- **WHEN** the system processes the activities
- **THEN** the pipeline SHALL produce deterministic results

### Requirement: Primary Data Flow

The system SHALL process activities through the following sequence: Activity fetches data from Strava API, Activity Guardrails validates raw activity data, Activity Signals extracts semantic signals, Activity Prompt Generation creates image prompts, Activity Guardrails validates prompts, and Image Generation produces final output.

#### Scenario: Successful activity processing flow
- **GIVEN** a valid activity ID from Strava webhook
- **WHEN** the system processes the activity
- **THEN** each module SHALL be invoked in sequence: Activity → Activity Guardrails → Activity Signals → Activity Prompt Generation → Activity Guardrails → Image Generation

#### Scenario: Module dependency enforcement

#### Scenario: Intensity classification
- **GIVEN** activity data with performance metrics
- **WHEN** classifying intensity
- **THEN** the system SHALL classify activities as Low (recovery, easy, relaxed), Medium (steady, focused, moderate), or High (intense, demanding, race-level)

#### Scenario: Environmental context extraction
- **GIVEN** activity data with elevation, time, weather, or location information
- **WHEN** extracting environmental context

### Requirement: Activity Prompt Generation Pipeline
