# System Architecture Requirements

Architectural requirements for the PACE system's service-oriented architecture.

## Requirement: Core Functionality Pipeline

The system SHALL operate as a rule-based, deterministic pipeline that ingests Strava activity data via the Strava API, extracts semantic signals from activity metadata, generates text prompts following strict safety and content guardrails, creates artistic images using AI image generation models, and validates outputs to ensure compliance with all system constraints.

#### Scenario: Complete activity processing pipeline
- **GIVEN** a Strava activity ID from a webhook
- **WHEN** the system processes the activity

#### Scenario: Deterministic pipeline behavior
- **GIVEN** identical activity inputs
- **WHEN** the system processes the activities
- **THEN** the pipeline SHALL produce deterministic results

## Requirement: Primary Data Flow

The system SHALL process activities through the following sequence: Activity Service fetches data from Strava API, Guardrails Service validates raw activity data, Activity Signals Service extracts semantic signals, Prompt Generation Service creates image prompts, Guardrails Service validates prompts, and Image Generation Service produces final output.

#### Scenario: Successful activity processing flow
- **GIVEN** a valid activity ID from Strava webhook
- **WHEN** the system processes the activity
- **THEN** each service SHALL be invoked in sequence: Activity Service → Guardrails Service → Activity Signals Service → Prompt Generation Service → Guardrails Service → Image Generation Service

#### Scenario: Intensity classification
- **GIVEN** activity data with performance metrics
- **WHEN** classifying intensity
- **THEN** the system SHALL classify activities as Low (recovery, easy, relaxed), Medium (steady, focused, moderate), or High (intense, demanding, race-level)

#### Scenario: Environmental context extraction
- **GIVEN** activity data with elevation, time, weather, or location information
- **WHEN** extracting environmental context
