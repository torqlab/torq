/**
 * Assembles final prompt text from prompt components with quality-enhancing keywords.
 *
 * Constructs the complete prompt text within character limit, including:
 * - Style-specific quality keywords (professional, polished, elegant, etc.)
 * - Human anatomy quality terms (anatomically correct, well-proportioned)
 * - General quality keywords (high quality, sharp, beautiful)
 *
 * Quality keywords address:
 * - Style-specific art direction (professional editorial illustration, modern animation style, etc.)
 * - Human quality terms (style-appropriate: character design for cartoon, professional anatomy for illustrated)
 * - Visual appeal and overall quality (high quality, sharp, beautiful)
 *
 * If over character limit, truncates scene details first while preserving quality keywords.
 *
 * @param {StravaActivitySignals} signals - Strava activity signals.
 * @returns {string} Assembled prompt text (max 600 characters).
