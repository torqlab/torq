# Specification Validation (Orchestration) Specification

This specification defines the **orchestration and execution order** of the Specification Validation.

This is a **Level 3 integration specification**.

It defines:
- Stage ordering
- Data flow between pipeline stages
- Failure propagation rules
- Execution invariants

This specification **does not** define validation rules or AI behavior.
Those are owned by lower levels.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this specification is to define **how** the validation
pipeline is executed as a composed system.

This specification ensures that:
- Pipeline execution is deterministic
- Stage ordering is fixed and unambiguous
- Failures propagate consistently
- No stage may be skipped or reordered

## 2. Orchestration Scope

This orchestration applies to:
- CI validation runs
- Automated validation services
- Any environment executing the validation pipeline end-to-end

It applies **only** to pipeline execution, not rule definition.

## 3. Execution Model

The pipeline **MUST** be executed as a strictly ordered sequence
of stages defined in the Level 2 pipeline behavior specification.

Stages **MUST NOT**:
- Execute in parallel
- Be reordered
- Be conditionally skipped (unless explicitly specified)

## 4. Orchestrated Execution Flow

The pipeline **MUST** execute the following stages in order:

1. Load Stage  
2. Structural Validation Stage  
3. Semantic Validation Stage  
4. Cross-Spec Validation Stage  

Each stage:
- Receives the full accumulated validation context
- **MAY** append validation results
- **MUST NOT** modify inputs from previous stages

## 5. Stage Transition Rules

### 5.1 Success Transition

If a stage completes without **INVALID** result:
- Execution proceeds to the next stage
- All accumulated violations are preserved

### 5.2 Failure Transition

If a stage produces an **INVALID** result:
- Pipeline execution **MUST STOP**
- No further stages **MUST** execute
- The final output **MUST** reflect the accumulated violations

## 6. Failure Propagation

Failure propagation rules:

- **INVALID** is terminal
- **CONDITIONALLY VALID** does not stop execution
- Final result precedence:
  - INVALID > CONDITIONALLY VALID > VALID

No stage **MAY** downgrade an existing **INVALID** result.

## 7. Data Flow Invariants

The orchestration **MUST** guarantee:

- Identical inputs → identical execution path
- Identical execution path → identical output
- No stage introduces randomness
- No stage depends on external state

Violation → **INVALID**

## 8. Ownership and Boundaries

This specification **MUST NOT**:

- Redefine validation rules
- Redefine AI prompts
- Redefine guardrails
- Introduce domain logic

Ownership is strictly divided:

- Rules → Level 0 (Meta)
- AI constraints → Level 1 (Guardrails)
- Validation behavior → Level 2 (Behavior)
- Execution order → Level 3 (this specification)

## 9. Authority

This specification is the **sole owner** of:

- Validation pipeline orchestration
- Stage ordering
- Failure propagation semantics

No other specification may redefine pipeline execution order.

## Summary

This specification defines the **integration-level orchestration**
of the Specification Validation Pipeline.

Its goals are to:
- Centralize execution order
- Prevent implicit orchestration logic
- Guarantee deterministic end-to-end behavior
- Keep lower levels free of orchestration concerns

All validation pipeline executions **MUST** follow this specification.
