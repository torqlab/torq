# Specification Validator Checklist Specification

This document defines a **formal, deterministic checklist** for validating any system specification against the Zero Specification.

The checklist is **normative**.
A specification is considered **invalid** if any mandatory check fails.

This document defines **validation rules**, not implementation.

---

## How to Use This Checklist

For every specification file:

1. Identify its declared level
2. Run **all General Checks**
3. Run **Level-Specific Checks**
4. Record validation result:
   - VALID
   - CONDITIONALLY VALID
   - INVALID

---

## 1. General Checks (All Levels)

These checks apply to **every specification**, regardless of level.

### 1.1 Front Matter Validation

The specification MUST contain front matter with:

- id
- version
- level
- status
- dependencies

Validation rules:

- id MUST be unique across all specs
- version MUST follow semantic versioning
- level MUST be an integer
- status MUST be one of:
  - canonical
  - regular
  - draft
  - deprecated
- scope MUST be explicitly stated
- dependencies MUST be explicit or N/A

Failure of any rule → INVALID

---

### 1.2 File Naming Validation

File name MUST follow:

<level>-<number>-<name>.spec.md

Rules:

- level in filename MUST match front matter level
- filename MUST be stable across versions
- number MUST be numeric and sortable

Failure → INVALID

---

### 1.3 Dependency Validation

Dependencies MUST satisfy:

- Only lower-level dependencies allowed
- No circular dependencies
- All dependencies MUST exist
- Dependency filenames MUST be exact

Failure → INVALID

---

### 1.4 Rule Language Validation

The specification MUST:

- Use MUST / MUST NOT / MAY / SHOULD explicitly
- Avoid ambiguous language
- Avoid implementation terms

Failure → CONDITIONALLY VALID

---

### 1.5 Duplication Check

The specification MUST NOT:

- Duplicate rules owned by another level
- Rephrase higher-level rules as new ones

Failure → INVALID

---

## 2. Level 0 — Zero Specification Checklist

### 2.1 Allowed Content

A Level 0 spec MAY define:

- Specification hierarchy
- Rule ownership rules
- Dependency rules
- Versioning policy
- Validation criteria

---

### 2.2 Forbidden Content

A Level 0 spec MUST NOT:

- Define domain behavior
- Define runtime logic
- Define safety or content constraints
- Reference implementation details

Failure → INVALID

---

### 2.3 Authority Check

Zero Spec MUST:

- Explicitly define conflict resolution order
- Declare itself as highest authority

Failure → INVALID

---

## 3. Level 1 — Global Guardrails Checklist

### 3.1 Allowed Content

A Level 1 spec MAY define:

- Global safety constraints
- Content and style boundaries
- Determinism rules
- Retry and fallback limits
- Input sanitization rules

---

### 3.2 Forbidden Content

A Level 1 spec MUST NOT:

- Define domain-specific logic
- Define transformation algorithms
- Define orchestration or sequencing
- Reference UI or infrastructure

Failure → INVALID

---

### 3.3 Downward Restriction Check

Level 1 rules MUST:

- Restrict lower levels
- Never depend on lower-level behavior

Failure → INVALID

---

## 4. Level 2 — Domain Specification Checklist

### 4.1 Allowed Content

A Level 2 spec MAY define:

- Domain inputs and outputs
- Classification rules
- Transformation rules
- Validation logic

---

### 4.2 Required References

A Level 2 spec MUST:

- Explicitly reference Guardrails
- Comply with all Level 1 constraints

Failure → INVALID

---

### 4.3 Forbidden Content

A Level 2 spec MUST NOT:

- Redefine guardrails
- Define orchestration logic
- Define infrastructure behavior

Failure → INVALID

---

## 5. Level 3 — Integration Specification Checklist

### 5.1 Allowed Content

A Level 3 spec MAY define:

- Data flow between domains
- Ordering rules
- Failure propagation rules
- Interface contracts

---

### 5.2 Forbidden Content

A Level 3 spec MUST NOT:

- Redefine domain logic
- Define safety or content rules
- Introduce new domain constraints

Failure → INVALID

---

## 6. Level 4 — Implementation Notes Checklist

### 6.1 Allowed Content

A Level 4 spec MAY include:

- Examples
- Clarifications
- Rationale

---

### 6.2 Forbidden Content

A Level 4 spec MUST NOT:

- Introduce new rules
- Contradict higher-level specs
- Be referenced as normative dependency

Failure → INVALID

---

## 7. Versioning Validation

For any spec change:

- Structural change → version bump REQUIRED
- Behavioral change → version bump REQUIRED
- Clarification only → version bump OPTIONAL

Breaking changes MUST be documented.

Failure → CONDITIONALLY VALID

---

## 8. Final Validation Result

A specification is:

- VALID — all mandatory checks pass
- CONDITIONALLY VALID — only non-critical checks fail
- INVALID — any mandatory check fails

Invalid specifications MUST NOT be used.

---

## Summary

This checklist provides a **formal, repeatable validation mechanism** for all specifications.

Its goals are to:

- Enforce Zero Specification authority
- Prevent rule duplication
- Preserve determinism
- Make specification review mechanical and objective

All current and future specifications MUST pass this checklist.
