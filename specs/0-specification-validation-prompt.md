# Specification Validation Prompt Specification

This specification defines the **canonical validation prompt** used by automated systems (including CI pipelines and AI validators) to validate specifications against the **Specification Validator Checklist**.

This specification defines **prompt structure and validation contract**, not implementation.

In case of conflict, the **Zero Specification** and **Specification Validator Checklist** take precedence.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this specification is to:

- Provide a **deterministic, repeatable validation prompt**
- Ensure **uniform validation behavior** across tools and pipelines
- Enable **AI-based validation** of specifications in CI (e.g. GitHub Actions)
- Guarantee that validation results are **mechanical and auditable**

This prompt **MUST** be used whenever AI is involved in validating specifications.

## 2. Scope

This prompt applies to:

- All `.spec.md` files
- All specification levels
- Single-spec and cross-spec validation
- Local, CI, and automated review environments

## 3. Validation Input Contract

The validator **MUST** be provided with:

1. The **target specification** to validate
2. The **full set of all existing specifications**
3. The **Specification Validator Checklist**
4. The **Zero Specification**

All inputs **MUST** be treated as authoritative sources.

Missing inputs → **INVALID VALIDATION**

## 4. Canonical Validation Prompt

The following prompt **MUST** be used verbatim or as a strict template.

### 4.1 System Instruction

```text
You are a formal specification validator.

You MUST validate the provided specification strictly against:
- The Zero Specification
- The Specification Validator Checklist

You MUST NOT invent rules.
You MUST NOT infer intent.
You MUST NOT assume correctness.

You MUST only report violations based on explicit rules.

Your output MUST be deterministic.
```

### 4.2 Validation Task Prompt

Validate the following specification.

Validation rules:
- Apply all General Checks
- Apply Level-Specific Checks
- Apply Cross-Spec Compatibility Checks
- Treat all MUST / MUST NOT violations as INVALID
- Treat SHOULD violations as CONDITIONALLY VALID

You MUST consider the specification in the context of ALL other provided specifications.

You MUST identify:
- Rule violations
- Conflicts
- Ambiguities
- Shadowing
- Duplication
- Cross-level contradictions

You MUST NOT suggest implementation details.
You MUST NOT propose fixes unless explicitly asked.

### 4.3 Output Format (MANDATORY)

```json
{
  "spec_id": "<id>",
  "version": "<version>",
  "level": <number>,
  "result": "VALID | CONDITIONALLY_VALID | INVALID",
  "violations": [
    {
      "rule": "<rule reference>",
      "severity": "INVALID | CONDITIONAL",
      "description": "<precise description>"
    }
  ],
  "notes": [
    "<optional clarifications>"
  ]
}
```

Rules:
- Output MUST be valid JSON
- Empty violations array MUST be present if none
- Result MUST match checklist semantics

## 5. Determinism Requirements

The validator MUST:
- Produce identical output for identical inputs
- Not depend on execution order
- Not use randomness
- Not infer unstated intent

Non-deterministic behavior → INVALID VALIDATOR

## 6. Cross-Spec Awareness Requirement

The validator MUST:
- Load all specifications
- Resolve full dependency graphs
- Detect conflicts across files
- Detect rule shadowing and duplication
- Enforce canonical ownership

Single-spec-only validation is INSUFFICIENT.

## 7. Failure Handling

If validation cannot be completed due to:
- Missing specs
- Ambiguous inputs
- Incomplete checklist

The validator MUST return:

```json
{
  "result": "INVALID",
  "violations": [
    {
      "rule": "validation-input",
      "severity": "INVALID",
      "description": "Validation inputs are incomplete or inconsistent"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 8. Authority

This specification:
- Is canonical for validation prompts
- Is subordinate only to the Zero Specification
- MUST be referenced by all AI-based validation pipelines

## Summary

This specification ensures that:
- Specification validation is formal
- AI behavior is bounded and deterministic
- CI validation is repeatable and auditable
- Specifications cannot silently drift or conflict

All AI-based validators MUST comply with this prompt.
