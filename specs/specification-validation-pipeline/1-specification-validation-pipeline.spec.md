# Specification Validation Pipeline Specification

This specification defines **global, mandatory guardrails** for all AI-based specification validation.

It applies to **any AI system** performing validation of specifications.

This is a **Level 1 guardrail specification**.
It defines **constraints**, not pipelines or implementations.

## 1. Purpose

This specification ensures that AI-based validation is:

- Deterministic
- Rule-bound
- Non-inferential
- Auditable

## 2. Global AI Constraints

An AI validator **MUST**:

- Validate specifications strictly against authoritative specs
- Treat specifications as static text
- Never infer unstated intent
- Never invent rules
- Never assume correctness

## 3. Determinism Rules

An AI validator **MUST**:

- Produce identical output for identical inputs
- Not depend on execution order
- Not use randomness
- Not use probabilistic interpretation

Violation → **INVALID**

## 4. Prohibited Behaviors

An AI validator **MUST NOT**:

- Suggest fixes
- Propose implementations
- Rewrite specifications
- Introduce new rules

Violation → **INVALID**

## 5. Authority

This specification is **canonical** for AI behavior during validation.

All AI-based validation **MUST** comply with these guardrails.
